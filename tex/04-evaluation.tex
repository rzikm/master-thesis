\chapter{Evaluation}

In this chapter we evaluate the managed QUIC implementation developed as part of this thesis. We
will evaluate interoperability of our implementation with other QUIC implementations, mainly
\libmsquic{}. \todo{can I get others?}. We will also compare the performance characteristics of the
managed and \libmsquic{}-based QUIC implementation providers, and how they compare to using
\class{SslStream} which TCP and TLS.

\subsection{Performance Comparison}

There are two performance characteristics which are relevant for networking protocol implementations:

\begin{itemize}

  \litem{Throughput} The rate at which the application data is sent.

  \litem{Round Trip Time Latency} The delay between sending a request and receiving a response.

\end{itemize}
